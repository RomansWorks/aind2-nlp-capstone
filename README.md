# About

This is my solution to the NLP Translation project of the Udacity NLP Nandegree. 

# Running

The solution was converted to work on Google Colab, due to limitations in the older versions of Keras and Tensorflow of the Udacity native environment. 

The notebook contains the code that clones the repository and copies the relevant files. 

Simply import the notebook in Colab and run it.
